A weeks ago, we're asked to give **one** question to another participant and in this post i will try to answer your question my fellow comrades. I pick three of several questions that I thought would be interesting to answer.

### How do you tackle burn out when learning about so many things in so little time?

I don't have an interesting answer for this. But..
**First**, try to enjoy every process and looks at the good side. You will never feel overwhelmed when you enjoy it.

I love writing weekly reflection, i even made an art for every post.

I Overengineering my homework because i love experimenting with react and i enjoy every process, from research until solving all the problem.

**Second?**, Take a break and play some games :)
Playing video games with friends is good for your sanity during this pandemic, this also boost your mood to continue learning.

### What is your effective method of learning? Especially during virtual learning class.

After you learning something try to share your thought to your friends (eg: via social media). This is like *recap-ing* what you just learn and sharing with your friends, sometimes if your friends is also learn same topic they will response and you have a discussion **and sometimes** you will have an another perspective (a win win) :)

It is similar with Prof. Feynman learning technique. You learning something by teaching someone as simple as possible, and it works for me.

### Could you please recommend any courses, books, or Youtube channels that have been useful to support your learning in GenerasiGIGIH?

For me one learning sources isn't enough, do googling and find the answer that suits you.
But here we go, ***"Wisesa's learning resources"***
