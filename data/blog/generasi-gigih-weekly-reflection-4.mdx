Wisesa here again and it's been four weeks since #GenerasiGigih Intermediate phase. Finally they released the _Xperience board_ and I'm finally at the top of the score board. Also they released the _Recognition Wall_ and i'm nominated as **Most recognized People in class**. Of course I am very happy, like _"my hard work finally paid off"_ haha. It was not easy _(to be honest)_ to be active in class because i'm kind of an _introvert_ person. But, i'm nailed it and in the recognition wall means my friends have a trust in me and that's makes me happy.

It's a burden to be honest wkw... become a top leaderboard, but i will try my best to defend my position at the first place until the end of the program by Keep become active in class and try help others. Also I believe I can advanced to the next level because i already spent most of my time on GenerasiGigih and make *Impact* at class.

> Being top global didn't stop me to improve myself. I believe _"nga ada yang sempurna"_ (nothing is perfect)  so I will keep pushing and do my best. gass...
