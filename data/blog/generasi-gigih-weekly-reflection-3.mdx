Hello there, i'm back again and it has been three weeks since I reached Intermediate level at #GenerasiGigih. I have been through a lot, If i can describe my journey in a natural event, **Rain** is a best way to describe it.

This three weeks, we learned about **basic** react.js, learn how to make project using CRA, how state works, and how to write statefull component using react hooks. It is easy for me, and that makes me easy to bored and too lazy to study again. But actually... it's okay as long as I can meet with new friends because they give me spirit to continue the program and I love to sharing about front-end development with them.

#### On a scale of 1-100%, how much have I put in the effort to participate in the learning process at #GenerasiGIGIH?

<br/>

Hmmm, *100%* + 10% wkw...

After my final thesis defense is finished i don't have much things to do so i spent majority of my time to learn react (again), read material before class started, help other participant with their homework (they usually DM me on discord, idk why), and overengineer my homework wkw...
