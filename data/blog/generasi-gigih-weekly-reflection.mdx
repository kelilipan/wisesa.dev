It was almost 3 months since I joined [#GenerasiGigih](https://sites.google.com/anakbangsabisa.org/generasi-gigih-portal-pendafta/generasi-gigih) a _Software Engineering_ bootcamp from Gojek & YABB.
#GenerasiGigih consist of 3 phase and now i'm at intermediate phase and it's been 2 weeks and here what i have done and what i feel about it. Here we go, a *"reflection"*...

At _front-end path_ we learn about basic JavaScript and learning how to build react.js application using [_Create-react-app_](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started). To be honest, it was easy for me to understand the material, because *JavaScript* is like a ***Mother language*** for me and i already made several project using react.js before, so the given homework and assignment is a *piece of cake*. Also, i always read a the material guidebook and react documentation before class started so it's like taking a two step ahead.
<br/>

At technical class we're building a playlist app using react.js. This is the fun part, i love exploring the layout, color, and how it looks because we're not given restrictions as long as the task meet the given requirement. I was planning to adding more feature as time goes by (because i have to wait for the others so i need to calm down wkw).

***But***, y'know? we not only learning about *software engineering* things, we also learning about Soft-skill & English. There's english class every Tuesday and Thursday, also a technical english class every Friday. It's quite challenging for me because this is like the first time i speak using english and even my grammar is quite good, but my pronounciation is bad wkwk (typical keyboard warrior). But this is actually what i looking for from this program, there is no doubt that English will be very useful for my next future job. I always want to take an English language course and i want to "at least good" at English and #GenerasiGigih is giving it for free wkwkw.

> Also, to be honest it's actually painful for me writing something like this using English. This is super try hard post.

My plan after this program ends is I will use this knowledge and all of my experience to apply job at tech company and achive what I've been dreaming of, to be useful and giving impact for society using my *Ninja* way ***"Through technology"***.
